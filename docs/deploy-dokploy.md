# Self-Hosting on Dokploy

This guide covers deploying OpenReply on your own server using [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com), as an alternative to the Vercel + Railway setup covered in `docs/setup.md`. Running everything on your own Dokploy instance means no per-seat hosting fees and no usage caps — but there are a few gotchas specific to this setup worth knowing up front.

## Overview

OpenReply needs four services running:
- **Web app** — the Next.js dashboard, OAuth callback, and webhook receiver
- **Worker** — a long-running Node process that sends the DMs (cannot run as a serverless function)
- **Postgres**
- **Redis**

On Dokploy, these become: one Postgres database service, one Redis database service, and **two separate Applications** pointing at the same repo (one for the web app, one for the worker), each with different start commands.

Since everything runs on the same Dokploy server, you don't need the "public vs internal database URL" split that the Vercel/Railway guide requires — both apps can just use Dokploy's internal service hostnames directly.

## Gotcha #1 — Node version

The repo doesn't pin a Node version, so Nixpacks (Dokploy's default build system) will default to an old version — too old for this project's dependencies (Prisma 7 and Next.js 16 both require Node 20.19+, 22.12+, or 24+).

Depending on which Nixpacks version your Dokploy instance ships, you may also find:
- Requesting Node 22 via `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION=22` resolves to a patch (e.g. 22.11.0) just below Prisma's 22.12 minimum
- Requesting Node 24 fails outright with `undefined variable 'nodejs_24'`, if the pinned Nix package snapshot predates Node 24's availability

**Fix:** add a `nixpacks.toml` file to the repo root to pin a newer, known-good Nix package snapshot:

```toml
[phases.setup]
nixpkgsArchive = "51ad838b03a05b1de6f9f2a0fffecee64a9788ee"
```

This snapshot provides Node 22.13.1, which satisfies Prisma's requirement. Then set:

```
NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION=22
```

as an environment variable on both the web app and worker app in Dokploy.

## Gotcha #2 — No dedicated "Build Command" field

Unlike Vercel/Railway, Dokploy's Nixpacks builder reads `package.json` scripts automatically and has no separate Build Command / Start Command UI field. To override the detected commands, set these as **environment variables** instead:

**Web app:**
```
NIXPACKS_BUILD_CMD=npx prisma generate && next build
NIXPACKS_START_CMD=npx prisma migrate deploy && npm start
```

**Worker app:**
```
NIXPACKS_BUILD_CMD=npm run db:generate
NIXPACKS_START_CMD=npm run worker
```

## Gotcha #3 — Migrations must run at start, not build

This is the one most likely to trip people up: **`prisma migrate deploy` cannot run during the Docker build step.** Docker builds run in an isolated environment with no access to Dokploy's internal service network, so the database isn't reachable yet — you'll see:

```
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `<db-service-name>:5432`
```

if you try to run migrations as part of the build (e.g. via the `vercel-build` script, which bundles `prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build` together). The fix is the build/start command split shown above — `prisma generate` and `next build` happen at build time (no DB needed), while `prisma migrate deploy` runs in the start command, once the container is actually live and on the network.

## Gotcha #4 — Nothing runs the cron jobs

The three jobs under `/api/cron` are scheduled by the `crons` block in
`vercel.json`. Nothing outside Vercel reads that file, so on a self-hosted
instance they simply never run — and none of them fails loudly:

- **`refresh-tokens`** is the one that hurts. The Instagram token expires and
  every automation stops, with no error anywhere: comments keep arriving and
  nothing answers them.
- **`attach-next-reel`** binds a campaign created ahead of time to the reel
  published after it. Without it, a "next reel" campaign stays inert forever.
- **`snapshot-followers`** keeps the follower history, which Instagram only
  retains for ~30 days.

**Fix:** run `scripts/cron.sh` as a fourth service, from the same image as the
web app — the same pattern as the worker, so the jobs live and die with the app
they belong to:

```yaml
  cron:
    image: <same image as web>
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["sh", "scripts/cron.sh"]
    environment:
      CRON_BASE_URL: http://web:3000
      CRON_SECRET: ${CRON_SECRET}
    depends_on:
      web:
        condition: service_healthy
```

`condition: service_healthy` matters: started alone, the first run fires while
the web app is still booting and dies on connection refused.

The script calls `attach-next-reel` every five minutes and the other two once a
day. Five minutes is deliberate — on Vercel this runs daily, which means a
campaign prepared before publishing stays inactive for the whole first evening,
when most of the comments arrive.

## Step-by-step

1. Fork this repo.
2. In Dokploy: **Create → Database → PostgreSQL** and **Create → Database → Redis**. Note their internal service hostnames.
3. In Dokploy: **Create → Application**, connect your fork, `main` branch. This is the web app.
4. Add the `nixpacks.toml` file (Gotcha #1) to your fork's root, and set the environment variables from Gotchas #1 and #2 (web app version) plus the standard variables from `.env.example` — pointing `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` at the internal hostnames from step 2.
5. Assign a domain to the web app only (not the worker) in Dokploy's Domains section, container port `3000`. This becomes your `NEXTAUTH_URL`.
6. Repeat step 3 for a second Application — this is the worker. Use the worker's build/start commands from Gotcha #2, and the same full set of environment variables as the web app, especially `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (these three must match exactly between both apps, or DM sends will fail to decrypt).
7. Deploy both apps.
8. Add the cron service from Gotcha #4, so the scheduled jobs actually run.
9. Check `https://your-domain/api/health` — confirms database, Redis, queue, and worker heartbeat are all healthy.

From here, the Meta app setup, OAuth redirect, and webhook configuration are identical to the standard setup in `docs/setup.md`.

## Production flow: image built in CI, Dokploy only pulls

Building on the server takes 15–20 minutes and nearly OOMs a 2 GB host, so production does not do that. Instead:

1. A push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`, which builds a `linux/arm64` image on a native arm runner and pushes it to `ghcr.io/verybigmotion/openreply:latest` (and `:<sha>`).
2. The last workflow step `POST`s the Dokploy compose webhook stored in the `DOKPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL` repo secret. There is no GitHub webhook on push, so Dokploy never deploys before the image exists.
3. Dokploy pulls the image and recreates web, worker and cron from `docker-compose.prod.yml`, which has no `build:` entries. The GHCR package is public, so no registry credentials are needed.

A deploy is pull + recreate only, well under a minute after the image is published.
